<br>Ah like every day I see
<br>Another day repeats I'm yawning all the time
<br>After all the cheers the night it fades out and
<br>Shibuya receives a pour of the morning light
<br>And somehow an emptiness surrounds
<br>That's what I always feel
<br>Something is not enough
<br>That's how it's gonna be
<br>It's all a part of life
<br>I'll let this be
<br>See what see what covered deep inside
<br>Let us hear the voice in you and resonate in you hold on
<br>Pretending won't bring it out of sight
<br>It is always waiting there for you
<br>Calling followed what I feel's to be drawn
<br>Going by my selection in this color then
<br>Suddenly with the breeze of a drowsy morning
<br>There was a world of blue shown in front of me
<br>Liking what you believe in and saying that you do
<br>Can be too terrifying but I know
<br>I've finally come across a true discovery of what I got
<br>Ah the more that I reach out my hands to what I need
<br>The further it becomes
<br>Another one of these unruly days go on
<br>I'm always in a hurry as I'm struggling
<br>Misery stemming from all my thoughts
<br>Humiliation brings new tears into my view
<br>The more that I step in the harder it becomes
<br>Even the pain renews
<br>Calling followed what I feel is the move
<br>Going by my selection in this path I walk
<br>On a night fighting off eyelids dropping heavy
<br>I'm grabbing tight the blue vow in front of me
<br>Taking what you believe and to keep doing so
<br>Every step's not only fun all the time
<br>Don't know if I'm able cause I am worried a little
<br><br>Ah "one line" was drawn
<br>Every "one line" was drawn
<br>Missing inner confidence I've drawn all pages I could draw
<br>Ah "one time" becomes
<br>Every "one time" becomes
<br>Soon a large accumulation of a strength inside of you
<br><br>All around I look at them
<br>Comparing what I do with them
<br>What is it only I can do that nobody else can
<br>Even if I've got no true confidence I'm moving on
<br><br>Covered in thoughts and emotion within
<br>Unknown to me a brand new feeling
<br>And on the day I took the step for the first time
<br>Including even this new pain that I felt too
<br>Liking what I believe in and facing it led
<br>To a touch of the preview of a light
<br>Gonna be alright let us go
<br>All I can do now is to have the fun
<br><br>Everything is on the line as I draw
<br>Using my own unique usage of colors and
<br>Every dawn every night I would keep on running
<br>And now I found the blue glowing light on me
<br>Liking what you believe in and facing it too
<br>Can be still terrifying but now I know
<br>No longer am I these versions of me living in transparency
<br>Now I know how to be my precious incomparable new self
<br>See what see what covered deep inside
<br>Let us hear the voice in you and resonate in you hold on
<br>Pretending won't bring it out of sight
<br>It is always waiting there still always waiting there for you and
<br>See what see what covered deep inside
<br>Let us hear the voice in you and resonate in you hold on
<br>Pretending won't bring it out of sight
<br>It is always waiting there waiting inside of you
